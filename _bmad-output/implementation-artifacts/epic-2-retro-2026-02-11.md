# Epic 2 Retrospective - Explore Redis and Memcached Data

- Date: 2026-02-11
- Epic: 2
- Epic Title: Explore Redis and Memcached Data
- Facilitator: Bob (Scrum Master)
- Project Lead: Jay
- Participants: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Senior Dev, QA Engineer, Junior Dev

## 1) Epic Summary

- Stories completed: 7/7
- Epic status in sprint tracker: `done`
- Retrospective status: completed by this document
- Scope delivered:
  - Redis key discovery with progressive, cancelable search
  - Redis key metadata enrichment (type + TTL)
  - Redis inspectors for strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, and streams with safety caps
  - Memcached value fetch with metadata and recoverable errors
  - Memcached server stats with refresh/retry behavior

## 2) Story Analysis Synthesis

### Delivery and Quality Patterns

- All stories were completed with consistent validation runs (`lint`, `typecheck`, `test`).
- Shared contract-first implementation kept IPC and renderer behavior aligned.
- Senior review closed recurring medium/high issues before final `done` state.

### Common Struggles (Recurring in 2+ stories)

1. Cancellation correctness across long-running flows
- Metadata and inspector paths required explicit cancellation-aware handling.
- Impact: risk of stale updates and noisy UI if not consistently enforced.

2. Safe-cap semantics and partial-result communication
- Multiple stories needed explicit cap metadata and user-facing “partial” states.
- Impact: without strong signaling, users could misread incomplete data as complete.

3. Error normalization across protocols
- Redis and Memcached paths required consistent envelope mapping for recoverability.
- Impact: inconsistent error shape would degrade retry guidance and confidence.

### Breakthrough Moments

1. Unified explorer/inspector job model enabled progressive behavior without UI blocking.
2. Type-discriminated inspector payloads scaled cleanly from strings/hashes to collections/streams.
3. Memcached protocol parsing hardening improved stability for hit/miss/error workflows.

### Collaboration Highlights

- Dev and QA collaboration produced broad behavior coverage for progressive, cancel, and cap paths.
- Product and engineering alignment kept safe UX messaging clear and actionable.
- Repeated review feedback was quickly converted into systematic fixes.

## 3) Technical Debt and Open Risks

### Technical Debt Captured

1. Repeated need for cancellation invariants across async paths.
2. Continued pressure on inspector UX clarity when partial data is shown.
3. Potential drift risk if new inspector types bypass existing contract patterns.

### Debt Severity

- Critical: None identified.
- Medium: Cancellation and cap-state consistency enforcement.
- Low: Additional UX polish for partial-state explanations.

## 4) Previous Retro Continuity (Epic 1 Follow-Through)

Epic 1 committed five action areas. Follow-through status for Epic 2:

- ✅ Centralized transition/safety invariants: applied through stronger session and handler behavior.
- ✅ Status/event publication discipline: improved through contract and handler consistency.
- ✅ Regression emphasis for critical behavior: reflected in recurring main/renderer tests per story.
- ⏳ Explicit stakeholder acceptance checkpoint formalization: partially present, still can be formalized as a fixed close gate.
- ✅ Retrospective and epic status hygiene: Epic 1 and Epic 2 now both tracked with retrospective completion.

## 5) Next Epic Preview (Epic 3)

- Epic 3 Title: Interpret Values Safely
- Planned stories: 6 (`3-1` through `3-6`)
- Dependency on Epic 2: High
  - Builds directly on inspector foundation and current safety-cap behavior
  - Requires reliable redaction/reveal/copy semantics layered on current viewers

### Preparation Needed Before Epic 3 Story Execution

1. Lock redaction-by-default rules as shared logic (single source of truth).
2. Define reveal-state lifecycle rules (navigation, relock, and copy defaults).
3. Add focused tests for raw/formatted/decode switching plus safe-copy behavior.
4. Confirm UX language for redaction and reveal states is consistent across all inspector types.

## 6) Significant Discoveries and Plan Impact

### Significant Discoveries

1. The current architecture supports Epic 3 without structural rework.
2. Most residual risk is behavioral consistency, not missing platform capability.

### Epic Update Required

- Epic 3 full replan required: No
- Epic 3 prep hardening required: Yes (quality and safety behavior consistency)

## 7) Readiness Assessment

Project Lead confirmation captured during retrospective: “it all looks good.”

- Testing and Quality: Good
- Deployment Status: Good
- Stakeholder Acceptance: Good
- Codebase Health: Good

Assessment outcome:
- Epic 2 is complete and ready.
- Team can proceed to Epic 3 after prep tasks in Section 5 are tracked.

## 8) Action Plan

### Action Items

1. Owner: Senior Dev
- Publish a single redaction policy module used by all inspector variants.
- Success criteria: one contract-backed path for redaction decisions.

2. Owner: QA Engineer
- Add cross-type regression tests for reveal/relock/copy safety behavior.
- Success criteria: passing tests cover string/hash/collection/stream paths.

3. Owner: Product Owner
- Finalize canonical UX copy for redaction, reveal, and cap-reached states.
- Success criteria: consistent wording across explorer and inspector UI.

4. Owner: Scrum Master
- Add Epic 3 kickoff checklist item: verify prep tasks completed before first story starts.
- Success criteria: checklist explicitly reviewed at kickoff.

### Critical Path Items Before Epic 3 Kickoff

1. Shared redaction policy module approved.
2. Cross-type safety regression suite passing.
3. UX safety-state copy finalized.

## 9) Commitments

- Team commits to preserving cancellation and cap semantics as non-negotiable quality gates.
- Team commits to redaction-by-default behavior consistency across all value types.
- Team commits to reviewing prep completion explicitly before Epic 3 execution.

## 10) Closure

Bob (Scrum Master): "Epic 2 retrospective is complete. The team delivered full scope and identified concrete prep for Epic 3."

Alice (Product Owner): "Direction is clear, and readiness is confirmed."

Charlie (Senior Dev): "Foundation is strong; next step is consistency hardening for safety workflows."

Dana (QA Engineer): "We have clear coverage priorities before Epic 3 starts."
